//TODO: Include description of the project.

Thomas_Haddy_Project2.zip contains the source files: res.txt, alloc.c, prov-rep.c,
main.c, and main.h.
There is a Makefile to compile the source code. Do the following to compile:

1. Go to the directory where you unzipped from the terminal (Use "cd")
2. Type "make"
3. Type "./project2"

The program should be running assuming it's running on a UNIX-based Operating System.
